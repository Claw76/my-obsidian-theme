# Letard's Obsidian Theme

_Notice:_

> Theme is currently not completely compatible with changes made in Obsidian 1.0

What was once just a collection of snippets in my vault is now a "theme".  
Toggling features on/off is made possible by the `Style Settings`-plugin.

> This Theme is mainly for my personal use and is basically just an extension of the default theme.  
> Don't expect this to be a "good" theme in any shape or form.

## Credits

-   Removing the sidebar/ribbons was taken from/ inspired by **Mado Miniflow**
-   Highlighting the active line was taken from **Shimmering Focus**

> If you notice features that are taken from another theme and not listed in the credits, please open an issue and I'll take a look at it. The snippets that make up this theme have been in use by me for quite some time so it's entirely possible that I forgot something.
